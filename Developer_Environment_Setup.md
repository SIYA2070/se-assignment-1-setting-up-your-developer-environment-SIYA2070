**Reflection**

During the setup of my developer environment, I encountered several challenges, particularly with the GitHub and committing parts of the version control system setup. Here’s a detailed account of the issues I faced and how I overcame them

**Challenges Faced**

1 Creating and Cloning the GitHub Repository
    Initially, I struggled with creating a new repository on GitHub. The interface seemed overwhelming at first, and I was unsure about the various options such as repository visibility (public vs private) and initializing with a README file.
    After successfully creating the repository, I had issues cloning it to my computer. The clone URL provided by GitHub was not recognized in my Git Bash terminal, leading to more confusion & Frustration.

2 Configuring Git
    Setting up Git with my username and email was straightforward, but I faced difficulties when trying to push commits to GitHub. I received several authentication errors, which were caused by not configuring SSH keys properly for secure access.

3 Making the First Commit
    Making the first commit was another hurdle. I was unfamiliar with the sequence of commands needed to add files to the staging area and then commit them. Additionally, I wasn't sure about the significance of commit messages and best practices for writing them

**Strategies Employed**

1 Research

To address these issues, I turned to online resources and tutorials. GitHub’s official documentation was particularly helpful in guiding me through the repository creation process. I also watched several YouTube videos that provided step-by-step instructions on cloning repositories and configuring Git

2 Practicing Git Commands

To become more comfortable with Git commands, I practiced the sequence of git add, git commit, and git push on a sample project. This hands-on practice helped solidify my understanding of how version control works and the importance of each command in the workflow.

3 Seeking Help from Peers

When I was stuck, I reached out to peers who had more experience with Git and GitHub. Their explanations and demonstrations were very insightful and aided me grasp the concepts and have more knowledge

**Conclusion** 

    In conclusion while the process of setting up GitHub and making my first commits was challenging, the experience was highly educational. The difficulties I encountered and the strategies I used to overcome them have given me a deeper understanding of version control, which is crucial for any software development project. This reflection not only highlights the challenges but also serves as a roadmap for continuous improvement in managing version control systems.
